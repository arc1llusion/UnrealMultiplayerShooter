If content doesn't work now or in the future

1. Create project using Unreal Learning Kit
2. Import Assets from unreal store:
    - Military Weapons Silver
    - Animation Starter Pack

3. Get Mixamo Animations
    1. Crypto or Xbot character
    2. Download appropriate animations (Turn left in place for standing and crouch, turn right in place for standing and crouch, Jump up, jump loop, jump down, reloading, toss grenade)
    3. Follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sLnCqBaElI for retargeting animations

Project is configured to use Rider but I imagine this can be changed
